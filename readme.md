# How it works

```
Alpha is a virtual voice assistant service. It can understand
human speech and perform basic tasks designed by the client.

When the user specifies the appropriate trigger words  Alpha,
Alpha gets activated and executes the user commands.

Alpha Hello, Hi or Hey" (Greets the user according to time)

The implemented Voice assistant can perform the following tasks:


Opens a webpage: Alpha open Youtube, G-Mail, Google Chrome, Facebook
User: Alpha, Open Youtube

Tell time
User: Alpha, time

Fetch Top headlines from CNN
User: Hey Alpha, news?
open CNN page

Captures a photo
User: Alpha, Take a photo or camera

Searches data from web
User: Alpha, Search Butterfly images from the web

Ask geographical and computational questions
User: Alpha, weather
Predict Weather of different Cities

User: Alpha, Wikipedia Ruby
The voice assistant abstracts the first 3 lines of Wikipedia and gives the information to the user.

Ask Alpha about what task it can perform and who created it
User: Alpha, Who created you? / Alpha, What can you do

Log off your pc when required
User: Alpha , log off or sing out
